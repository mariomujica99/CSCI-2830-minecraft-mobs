# Mario Mujica - Minecraft Mobs

For my semester project, I created a Minecraft mob creature application. The application shows a list of mob creatures using JavaFX GUI. The names of the mobs show on the main screen. When a mob creature is clicked, it takes the user to a description page about the mob. The description includes health, damage, behavior, spawn locations, size of mob, and a general description. In the main page, the user can sort the mobs by their health, damage, and size. The user can also filter by the dimension the mob creature is from.
